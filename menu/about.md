Hello! I'm Jesse. I am a topologist, an amateur machine learning specialist, a husband, a vocalist, a mediocre powerlifter, and a bad guitar player. While I have several interests, I am working on deleting some and focusing on others. In particular, I am spending a lot more time studying Machine Learning these days.

__The Past:__
* `[2014-2016]` I decided to pursue a degree in pure mathematics, entering into a master's degree. At the time, I really enjoyed functional analysis.
* `[2016-2017]` After finishing my master's, I decided to pursue my Ph.D. at UNL. The initial coursework was very easy and I could have probably skipped a year. In spite of that, the qualifying exams were a real challenge and they certainly pushed me to become a better mathematician. Of all the courses I took that first year, I was totally enamoured with algebraic topology (taught by Mark Brittenham, student of Allen Hatcher). I continued to take courses in analysis, algebra, and topology. In the Fall of 2017, I married my wife under the trees in Iowa and I took my first course in differential topology.
* `[2017-2019]` I spent this time becoming acquainted with topology in dimensions 3 and 4, preparing for and passing my comprehensive exams, and getting into my field of research. I read several papers about Curves and Surfaces, Knots, Heegaard Splittings of 3-manifolds, and Trisections of 4-manifolds. I attended many graduate-level conferences in topology and met lots of topologists. My wife and I bought our first house in the summer of 2018. In the Fall of 2019, I was invited to study in Germany at MPI. That was really, really cool.
* `[2019-2020]` While in Germany, in spite of being surrounded by all that Topology has to offer, I made the decision to pursue a career outside of academia after I finish my degree. I applied for an ORISE fellowship with several projects in mind - all involving machine learning to some extent. Early in 2020 I was offered the internship for the summer. Due to COVID-19, the internship went fully remote. It was a success. While we ended up building a fairly non-complicated model, there were no deep convolutional neural networks or anything of the sort, it was all brand new to me and I learned a large amount of information in a very short amount of time. This experience wetted my appetite for machine learning; a couple weeks after finishing the summer fellowship I took Andrew Ng's [excellent course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome) on Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

__The Present:__
* `[2020 - now]` I am working on my thesis (3-dimensional topology stuff), teaching, building my knowledge base about machine learning, trying to get a 500lbs deadlift, and trying to learn the finger pattern for Dust in the Wind. I want to consistently produce content for this blog that feels academic, but is casual in spirit.

__The Future:__
* `[Next Year]` I hope to find a data-adjacent job somewhere in the Midwest. I think it would be really nice to end up in Des Moines, Minneapolis, or Madison. I would prefer to work in a field related to agriculture, but the financial sector is a close second.
