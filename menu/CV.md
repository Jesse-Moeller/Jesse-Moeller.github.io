# Employment History / Funding Sources
---
### Graduate Assistantships 
* University of Nebraska - Lincoln (2016-present)
    * Instructor of record and recitation leader for several different courses (see teaching below)
    * Volunteer at UNL's Math Day
    * Speaker and organizer for the ongoing seminar [Groups, Semigroups, and Topology](https://www.math.unl.edu/groups-semigroups-and-topology)
* University of Northern Iowa (2014-2016)
    * I graded papers and I was also a tutor for the Math Lab, the UNI Math Department's free tutoring center.

### Awards
* Los Alamos National Labs, ORISE Fellow (Summer 2020)
    * I (virtually) interned with the XCP-5 division at the Los Alamos National Lab. Together with the staff scientists, I designed and implemented a machine learning model to predict systematic bias in experimental nuclear data.

* Max Planck Institute of Mathematics, Guest Researcher (Fall 2019)
    * A group of low-dimensional topologists were invited to the institute in Fall 2019 to work on topics in trisections and 4-dimensional topology. While I was there, I was able to classify the genus 3 Farey trisection diagrams (joint with Román Aranda).

### Private Sector

* CBE Companies, Analyst Intern II (May 2016 - August 2017)
    * Litigation Tool: Together with my boss, Brad Dellit, I helped design and implement a tool for the quality assurance team. While the tool has many features, I worked on the case-building functionality. Upon new litigation, the tool would retrieve all relevant documentation and audio scattered throughout the network. This project involved SAS, SQL, and Microsoft Access.
