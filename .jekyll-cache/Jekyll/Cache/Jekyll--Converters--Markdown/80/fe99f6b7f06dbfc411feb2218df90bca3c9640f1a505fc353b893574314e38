The application process is pretty simple; you tell them why you want the internship, what you’re capable of, and you select a few projects on their page which you think sound interesting. I wanted to learn more about machine learning by working on an interesting problem, and I wanted to gain more experience doing work in a non-academic setting, so this seemed like the perfect fit for me. That’s exactly what I put on my application, in a nutshell, and in March I got the acceptance email. I was in disbelief. Not only did I win a competetive award, but the project I was assigned to was my top choice. The project was titled “Improving Nuclear Data Estimates and Uncertainties Using Machine Learning” and this is the description that the mentors provided:</p>
