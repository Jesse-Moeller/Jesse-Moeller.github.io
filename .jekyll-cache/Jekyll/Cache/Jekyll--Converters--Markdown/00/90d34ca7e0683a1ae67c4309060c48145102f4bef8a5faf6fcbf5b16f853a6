I")<p>I love the internet. There is no shortage of free learning material on the internet. I learned calculus on the internet. Any meaningful progress I have made towards learning a computer skill has happened on the internet. Naturally, the internet would be there to help me get into machine learning. There are several dozen starting points available to get into machine learning from ground zero. After reviewing several books, and at the suggestion of one of the mentors from my summer internship, Mike Grosskopf, I decided to crack open Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL), by Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani. The book is freely availabe <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/">here</a>. I really appreciate the way this book is layed out: thereâ€™s a fundamental block of chapters which are, more or less, required by the others, but the rest of the book is a buffet of content and can be consumed in any order. Mike encouraged me to read through Chapter 3, one of those fundamental chapters, to try and learn about shrinkage methods.</p>
