I"ž<p>Hello! Iâ€™m Jesse. I am a topologist, an amateur machine learning specialist, a husband, a vocalist, a mediocre powerlifter, and a bad guitar player. While I have several interests, I am working on deleting some and focusing on others. In particular, I am spending a lot more time studying Machine Learning these days.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[2014-2016]</code> I decided to pursue a degree in pure mathematics, entering into a masterâ€™s degree. At the time, I really enjoyed functional analysis.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[2016-2017]</code> After finishing my masterâ€™s, I decided to pursue my Ph.D. at UNL. The initial coursework was very easy and I could have probably skipped a year. In spite of that, the qualifying exams were a real challenge and they certainly pushed me to become a better mathematician. Of all the courses I took that first year, I was totally enamoured with algebraic topology (taught by Mark Brittenham, student of Allen Hatcher). I continued to take courses in analysis, algebra, and topology. In the Fall of 2017, I married my wife under the trees in Iowa and I took my first course in differential topology.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[2017-2019]</code> I spent this time becoming acquainted with topology in dimensions 3 and 4, preparing for and passing my comprehensive exams, and getting into my field of research. I read several papers about Curves and Surfaces, Knots, Heegaard Splittings of 3-manifolds, and Trisections of 4-manifolds. I attended several graduate-level conferences in topology and met many interesting people.</li>
</ul>
